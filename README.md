##PlayAsyncTasks

This example demonstrates the creation of asynchronous tasks in Play Framework.

##Running

After starting the project using ```play run```, test the jobs created by using
the following URL pattern:

```http://localhost:9000/job/<jobname>```

I have created 4 jobs to test the above.
